The file here is short too
i write some notes of linux command line instead of code
because the internet here is bad
i dont have enough data to download the things i need to run a code
Some common command like
cp: copy the file
mv: move or rename the file
rm: remove or delete the file
chmod: change file permission
these command is very common in linux
so it dont relly need to note
add new file
end!
